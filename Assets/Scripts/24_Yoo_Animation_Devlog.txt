Current Task: finding out problems
    1. play again button seems not to be working
    2. Game over screen pops up even though the player hit the obstacle only once
        ( It has to be pop up at 3rd hit )
Struggling with play again button but doesn't seems to be fixed till today

Current Task: trying to fix the problem related to game over screen
Seems like I have to do something with Logic Script in order to fix that
Keep googling
Just realized that I have to fix Player script, not Logic script.
    (Tbh not 100% sure whether it's the right way or not but I'll make a try anyway)
Guess I could reuse the HitCount method that I originally used to change the appearence of the player sprite when it hits the obstacles
still googling

Current Task: finishing the game over screen thing
Watching Unity Tutorial youtube video again to make sure I understand "PlayerIsAlive" thing
Going through Unity Documentation webpage that is related to "if & else"
combined 'if' & "AirplaneIsAlive" to make sure the game over screen pops up at the 3rd hit of the player
Current Task: Struggling with scaling animation
Going through last week's in-class activity again(animation tutorial)
Decided to apply some basic scaling animation on my Cityscaape game
starting with really simple scaling up&down animation on the player sprite

The animation was working till I saved the project and turning my laptop to sleep mode but it's not today
Current task: Figuring out what happened during last night

Clicked the player object and went through the Animation panel but my animation is gone
clicking and discovering all the animation-related stuff in Unity
Just realized that the animation is saved like some sort of prefab at the Assets folder
Figuring out hou could I apply the animation back to the player sprite
Seems like I have to do something with animation controller
Searching some information about Animation trigger
    -Coffee Break-
Current Task: Finishing simple scaling animation
Learned that there's something I could do with Animator controller and parameter while going through Unity animation basics
made 'Fly' Animator controller
added 'Fly' Parameter
experimenting simple stuff on the Parameters tab on the Animator panel
    (seems like some sort of Block Coding tho)
connected animator component to the player sprite
Wanted to make the animation happen when I press the flying key(up arrow key) so looking for some information about setting the trigger
added animation trigger-related stuff to Playerscript
playing the game
    -> not 100% sure whether the trigger really works so I guess I have to make a Debug.log related to this
    -> that's gonna be the next task for now
